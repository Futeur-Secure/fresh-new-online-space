      questions: [
        { q: "What's the best free password manager for personal use?", a: "Bitwarden offers the most comprehensive free tier with unlimited passwords, cross-device sync, and strong security features. Other good options include LastPass (limited to one device type) and KeePass (local storage only)." },
        { q: "How do I remember my master password?", a: "Create a memorable passphrase using 4-6 random words, or use a sentence with personal meaning. Write it down physically until memorized, then destroy the paper. Never store it digitally." },
        { q: "Is it safe to store passwords in browser?", a: "Browser password storage is convenient but less secure than dedicated password managers. Browsers often lack advanced encryption, secure sharing, and comprehensive security features." },
        { q: "Should I trust cloud-based password managers?", a: "Reputable services like Bitwarden, 1Password use zero-knowledge encryption, meaning even they can't see your passwords. Your data is encrypted locally before being sent to the cloud." },
        { q: "How often should I change my passwords?", a: "Only change passwords when there's been a breach or compromise. Focus on using strong, unique passwords rather than frequent changes, which can lead to weaker passwords." },
        { q: "Can I use the same password for multiple accounts?", a: "Never reuse passwords across accounts. If one site is breached, all your accounts become vulnerable. Use a password manager to generate and store unique passwords for each account." },
        { q: "What makes a password strong?", a: "Strong passwords are long (12+ characters), include upper/lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid dictionary words, personal information, and common patterns. Use a password generator." },
        { q: "Should I enable two-factor authentication everywhere?", a: "Yes, enable 2FA on all important accounts, especially email, banking, and social media. Use an authenticator app rather than SMS when possible for better security." },
        { q: "What if I forget my master password?", a: "Most password managers don't have password recovery due to zero-knowledge encryption. Set up emergency access with trusted contacts or use backup codes. Some services offer limited recovery options." },
        { q: "How do I migrate from one password manager to another?", a: "Export your data from the old manager (usually CSV format), then import to the new one. Verify all data transferred correctly, then securely delete the export file." },
        { q: "Is Bitwarden really free forever?", a: "Bitwarden's free tier includes unlimited passwords and sync across devices. Premium features like 2FA, secure file storage, and priority support require a paid plan." },
        { q: "Can I use password managers on multiple devices?", a: "Yes, most password managers sync across unlimited devices. Your encrypted vault is accessible on phones, tablets, computers, and through browser extensions." },
        { q: "What happens if the password manager company goes out of business?", a: "Choose managers that provide data export features. Your encrypted data remains accessible through export files. This is why selecting established, well-funded companies matters." },
        { q: "Should I store credit card information in password managers?", a: "Yes, most password managers securely store payment cards, addresses, and other sensitive information. This is generally safer than storing them in browsers or writing them down." },
        { q: "How secure are password manager browser extensions?", a: "Reputable password manager extensions use secure communication with encrypted local storage. They're much safer than browser-saved passwords and offer better security features." }
      ]
    },
    // Enterprise FAQs (expanded)
    {
      category: 'Enterprise',
      questions: [
        { q: "What's the best password manager for enterprise use?", a: "Top enterprise solutions include 1Password Business, Bitwarden Business, and Dashlane Business. Look for centralized admin controls, SSO integration, policy enforcement, and compliance certifications." },
        { q: "How do we enforce password policies across the organization?", a: "Use enterprise password managers with policy enforcement features. Set minimum password requirements, force unique passwords, require 2FA, and monitor compliance through admin dashboards." },
        { q: "Should we allow personal use of company password managers?", a: "Many organizations allow limited personal use to encourage adoption. Set clear policies about what can be stored and ensure personal data doesn't interfere with business security." },
        { q: "How do we handle employee offboarding with shared passwords?", a: "Use password managers with role-based access control. When employees leave, immediately revoke access and rotate any passwords they had access to. Maintain audit logs of access." },
        { q: "What compliance requirements do password managers help with?", a: "Password managers help with SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, PCI DSS, and GDPR compliance by providing encryption, access controls, audit logs, and policy enforcement capabilities." },
        { q: "How do we integrate password managers with SSO?", a: "Most enterprise password managers integrate with SAML and OIDC providers. Use SSO for the password manager itself, while the password manager handles legacy applications without SSO support." },
        { q: "Should we use on-premises or cloud password managers?", a: "Cloud solutions offer better security, regular updates, and easier management. On-premises is only recommended for organizations with specific regulatory requirements or air-gapped environments." },
        { q: "How do we train employees on password manager usage?", a: "Provide hands-on training sessions, create documentation, offer regular security awareness training, and designate internal champions to help with adoption and support." },
        { q: "What's the ROI of enterprise password managers?", a: "Password managers reduce help desk calls, prevent breaches, improve productivity, and ensure compliance. Most organizations see ROI within 6-12 months through reduced security incidents." },
        { q: "How do we handle shared accounts and service passwords?", a: "Use dedicated shared vaults with appropriate access controls. Rotate shared passwords regularly, log access, and use service accounts with API keys where possible instead of shared passwords." },
        { q: "How much does enterprise password management cost?", a: "Enterprise solutions typically cost $3-8 per user per month. Consider the cost of potential breaches, help desk time, and productivity gains when evaluating pricing." },
        { q: "Can password managers integrate with Active Directory?", a: "Yes, most enterprise password managers integrate with Active Directory, LDAP, and other directory services for user provisioning, authentication, and group management." },
        { q: "How do we monitor password manager usage across the company?", a: "Enterprise dashboards provide usage analytics, security reports, compliance status, and user activity logs. Set up alerts for suspicious activity or policy violations." },
        { q: "What happens during password manager outages?", a: "Choose providers with high uptime SLAs and offline access capabilities. Maintain emergency access procedures and consider backup authentication methods for critical systems." },
        { q: "How do we handle password managers in different countries?", a: "Consider data residency requirements, local privacy laws, and compliance regulations. Some providers offer regional data centers and specific compliance certifications for different jurisdictions." }
      ]
    },
    // Security FAQs (expanded)
    {
      category: 'Security',
      questions: [
        { q: "How secure are password managers really?", a: "Password managers use military-grade encryption (AES-256) and zero-knowledge architecture. Even if breached, your encrypted data remains unreadable. They're far more secure than reusing passwords." },
        { q: "What happens if my password manager gets hacked?", a: "Reputable password managers use zero-knowledge encryption, so even if breached, your data remains encrypted and unusable. Change your master password and enable 2FA as precautions." },
        { q: "Should I use offline or online password managers?", a: "Online managers offer better convenience and sync across devices. Offline managers offer more control but require manual backup management. Choose based on your security vs. convenience needs." },
        { q: "How do I backup my password manager data?", a: "Export encrypted backups regularly and store them securely offline. Many managers offer automatic cloud backups. Keep backups in multiple locations and test restoration periodically." },
        { q: "Is biometric unlock secure for password managers?", a: "Biometric unlock is convenient and secure for device access. It doesn't replace your master password but adds a layer of security. Biometric data stays on your device and isn't sent to the cloud." },
        { q: "What are the risks of using password managers?", a: "Main risks include forgetting master password, device loss, and potential breaches. These risks are far outweighed by the security benefits compared to password reuse or weak passwords." },
        { q: "How do password managers protect against phishing?", a: "Password managers detect legitimate websites and won't autofill credentials on fake sites. They also enable unique passwords per site, limiting damage if one account is compromised." },
        { q: "Should I store other sensitive information in password managers?", a: "Most support secure storage of credit cards, identity documents, and secure notes. This is generally safe and convenient, but consider separate storage for extremely sensitive data like crypto keys." },
        { q: "How do I secure my password manager master password?", a: "Use a long, memorable passphrase. Enable 2FA. Never share it or store it digitally. Consider using a hardware security key for the highest security level." },
        { q: "What encryption do password managers use?", a: "Most use AES-256 encryption with PBKDF2, Argon2, or similar key derivation. Look for zero-knowledge architecture, meaning the service provider cannot decrypt your data." },
        { q: "Are password managers vulnerable to keyloggers?", a: "Password managers reduce keylogger risk by auto-filling credentials instead of typing them. Use virtual keyboards for master passwords on potentially compromised systems." },
        { q: "How do I know if my password manager is trustworthy?", a: "Look for open-source code, security audits, compliance certifications, and transparent security practices. Avoid newer, unproven services for critical password storage." },
        { q: "Can password managers be hacked through browser extensions?", a: "Browser extensions can have vulnerabilities, but reputable password managers regularly update their extensions and use secure communication protocols. Keep extensions updated." },
        { q: "Should I use different password managers for different purposes?", a: "Generally, one comprehensive password manager is better than multiple solutions. However, some organizations separate personal and business password management for policy reasons." },
        { q: "How do password managers handle zero-trust security models?", a: "Modern password managers align with zero-trust principles by requiring verification for each access, maintaining detailed audit logs, and providing granular access controls." }
