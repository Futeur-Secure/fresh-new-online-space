    // Personal FAQs
    {
      category: 'Personal',
      questions: [
        { q: "What's the best free password manager for personal use?", a: "Bitwarden offers the most comprehensive free tier with unlimited passwords, cross-device sync, and strong security features. Other good options include LastPass (limited to one device type) and KeePass (local storage only)." },
        { q: "How do I remember my master password?", a: "Create a memorable passphrase using 4-6 random words, or use a sentence with personal meaning. Write it down physically until memorized, then destroy the paper. Never store it digitally." },
        { q: "Is it safe to store passwords in browser?", a: "Browser password storage is convenient but less secure than dedicated password managers. Browsers often lack advanced encryption, secure sharing, and comprehensive security features." },
        { q: "Should I trust cloud-based password managers?", a: "Reputable services like Bitwarden, 1Password use zero-knowledge encryption, meaning even they can't see your passwords. Your data is encrypted locally before being sent to the cloud." },
        { q: "How often should I change my passwords?", a: "Only change passwords when there's been a breach or compromise. Focus on using strong, unique passwords rather than frequent changes, which can lead to weaker passwords." },
        { q: "Can I use the same password for multiple accounts?", a: "Never reuse passwords across accounts. If one site is breached, all your accounts become vulnerable. Use a password manager to generate and store unique passwords for each account." },
        { q: "What makes a password strong?", a: "Strong passwords are long (12+ characters), include upper/lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid dictionary words, personal information, and common patterns. Use a password generator." },
        { q: "Should I enable two-factor authentication everywhere?", a: "Yes, enable 2FA on all important accounts, especially email, banking, and social media. Use an authenticator app rather than SMS when possible for better security." },
        { q: "What if I forget my master password?", a: "Most password managers don't have password recovery due to zero-knowledge encryption. Set up emergency access with trusted contacts or use backup codes. Some services offer limited recovery options." },
        { q: "How do I migrate from one password manager to another?", a: "Export your data from the old manager (usually CSV format), then import to the new one. Verify all data transferred correctly, then securely delete the export file." }
      ]
    },
    // Enterprise FAQs
    {
      category: 'Enterprise',
      questions: [
        { q: "What's the best password manager for enterprise use?", a: "Top enterprise solutions include 1Password Business, Bitwarden Business, and Dashlane Business. Look for centralized admin controls, SSO integration, policy enforcement, and compliance certifications." },
        { q: "How do we enforce password policies across the organization?", a: "Use enterprise password managers with policy enforcement features. Set minimum password requirements, force unique passwords, require 2FA, and monitor compliance through admin dashboards." },
        { q: "Should we allow personal use of company password managers?", a: "Many organizations allow limited personal use to encourage adoption. Set clear policies about what can be stored and ensure personal data doesn't interfere with business security." },
        { q: "How do we handle employee offboarding with shared passwords?", a: "Use password managers with role-based access control. When employees leave, immediately revoke access and rotate any passwords they had access to. Maintain audit logs of access." },
        { q: "What compliance requirements do password managers help with?", a: "Password managers help with SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, PCI DSS, and GDPR compliance by providing encryption, access controls, audit logs, and policy enforcement capabilities." },
        { q: "How do we integrate password managers with SSO?", a: "Most enterprise password managers integrate with SAML and OIDC providers. Use SSO for the password manager itself, while the password manager handles legacy applications without SSO support." },
        { q: "Should we use on-premises or cloud password managers?", a: "Cloud solutions offer better security, regular updates, and easier management. On-premises is only recommended for organizations with specific regulatory requirements or air-gapped environments." },
        { q: "How do we train employees on password manager usage?", a: "Provide hands-on training sessions, create documentation, offer regular security awareness training, and designate internal champions to help with adoption and support." },
        { q: "What's the ROI of enterprise password managers?", a: "Password managers reduce help desk calls, prevent breaches, improve productivity, and ensure compliance. Most organizations see ROI within 6-12 months through reduced security incidents." },
        { q: "How do we handle shared accounts and service passwords?", a: "Use dedicated shared vaults with appropriate access controls. Rotate shared passwords regularly, log access, and use service accounts with API keys where possible instead of shared passwords." }
      ]
    },
    // Security FAQs
    {
      category: 'Security',
      questions: [
        { q: "How secure are password managers really?", a: "Password managers use military-grade encryption (AES-256) and zero-knowledge architecture. Even if breached, your encrypted data remains unreadable. They're far more secure than reusing passwords." },
        { q: "What happens if my password manager gets hacked?", a: "Reputable password managers use zero-knowledge encryption, so even if breached, your data remains encrypted and unusable. Change your master password and enable 2FA as precautions." },
        { q: "Should I use offline or online password managers?", a: "Online managers offer better convenience and sync across devices. Offline managers offer more control but require manual backup management. Choose based on your security vs. convenience needs." },
        { q: "How do I backup my password manager data?", a: "Export encrypted backups regularly and store them securely offline. Many managers offer automatic cloud backups. Keep backups in multiple locations and test restoration periodically." },
        { q: "Is biometric unlock secure for password managers?", a: "Biometric unlock is convenient and secure for device access. It doesn't replace your master password but adds a layer of security. Biometric data stays on your device and isn't sent to the cloud." },
        { q: "What are the risks of using password managers?", a: "Main risks include forgetting master password, device loss, and potential breaches. These risks are far outweighed by the security benefits compared to password reuse or weak passwords." },
        { q: "How do password managers protect against phishing?", a: "Password managers detect legitimate websites and won't autofill credentials on fake sites. They also enable unique passwords per site, limiting damage if one account is compromised." },
        { q: "Should I store other sensitive information in password managers?", a: "Most support secure storage of credit cards, identity documents, and secure notes. This is generally safe and convenient, but consider separate storage for extremely sensitive data like crypto keys." },
        { q: "How do I secure my password manager master password?", a: "Use a long, memorable passphrase. Enable 2FA. Never share it or store it digitally. Consider using a hardware security key for the highest security level." },
        { q: "What encryption do password managers use?", a: "Most use AES-256 encryption with PBKDF2, Argon2, or similar key derivation. Look for zero-knowledge architecture, meaning the service provider cannot decrypt your data." }
      ]
    },
    // Sharing FAQs
    {
      category: 'Sharing',
      questions: [
        { q: "How do I safely share passwords with family members?", a: "Use password managers with family sharing features like 1Password Families or Bitwarden Family Organization. Create shared vaults for common accounts while keeping personal passwords separate." },
        { q: "What's the safest way to share passwords at work?", a: "Use enterprise password managers with granular sharing controls. Share through secure vaults with appropriate permissions, audit trails, and the ability to revoke access when needed." },
        { q: "Should I share passwords via email or messaging apps?", a: "Never share passwords via email, SMS, or regular messaging apps. These are insecure and leave permanent records. Use password managers' secure sharing features or encrypted communication tools." },
        { q: "How do I share passwords temporarily?", a: "Use password managers' temporary sharing features that allow time-limited access. Some services offer secure one-time sharing links that expire after viewing or a set time period." },
        { q: "Can I share passwords without revealing them?", a: "Yes, many password managers allow sharing access without revealing the actual password. Users can log in through the manager without seeing the password text." },
        { q: "How do I manage shared passwords when team members leave?", a: "Use password managers with role-based access control. When someone leaves, revoke their access immediately and rotate any passwords they had access to. Maintain audit logs." },
        { q: "What permissions should I set for shared passwords?", a: "Set minimal necessary permissions. Options typically include view-only, use-only (autofill without revealing), edit, and admin rights. Review and update permissions regularly." },
        { q: "How do I share passwords with contractors or vendors?", a: "Create separate vaults for external access with limited permissions and time-based access controls. Use temporary sharing when possible and revoke access when projects end." },
        { q: "Is it safe to share Netflix or streaming passwords?", a: "While common, sharing streaming passwords may violate terms of service and poses security risks. If sharing, use password managers and ensure each person has their own profile." },
        { q: "How do I audit who has access to shared passwords?", a: "Use password managers with comprehensive audit logs. Review access logs regularly, check who has permissions to what, and remove unnecessary access. Set up alerts for suspicious activity." }
      ]
    },
    // General FAQs
    {
      category: 'General',
      questions: [
        { q: "Are password managers worth the cost?", a: "Absolutely. The security benefits far outweigh the cost. Many excellent options are free for personal use, and business plans prevent much more expensive security breaches." },
        { q: "Do password managers work on all devices?", a: "Major password managers support Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, and all major browsers. Look for unlimited device sync and cross-platform compatibility." },
        { q: "How do password managers autofill passwords?", a: "They use browser extensions and mobile keyboard integrations to detect login forms and automatically fill credentials. This works on websites and many mobile apps." },
        { q: "What if I travel to countries that block password managers?", a: "Some services offer travel mode that temporarily removes sensitive data from your devices. Research local laws and consider using VPNs where legal and appropriate." },
        { q: "Can password managers be used offline?", a: "Most store encrypted copies locally for offline access. You can view and use passwords without internet, but sync requires connectivity. Some are completely offline-only." },
        { q: "How do I choose between different password managers?", a: "Consider factors like security features, ease of use, device compatibility, sharing capabilities, customer support, pricing, and specific features you need." },
        { q: "Do password managers slow down my browsing?", a: "Modern password managers have minimal performance impact. They may add a small delay during autofill, but this is negligible compared to the time saved from not typing passwords." },
        { q: "How do password managers handle website changes?", a: "They're regularly updated to work with website changes. If autofill stops working, it's usually fixed quickly through updates. You can also manually save updated login forms." },
        { q: "Can I import passwords from browsers?", a: "Yes, all major password managers can import from Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and other browsers. They usually provide step-by-step import guides." },
        { q: "What happens to my passwords if the company shuts down?", a: "Reputable companies provide data export tools. Your encrypted data remains accessible through export files. This is why choosing established, well-funded companies is important." }
